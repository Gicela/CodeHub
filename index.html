  <h2>Codehub is organised by:</h2>

  <p><strong>Gicela: (<a href="http://twitter.com/gicela" title="Follow Gicela on Twitter">@gicela</a>)</strong> I've been developing web sites since the mid 1990's and have never stopped learning. Pretty much everythig I know I have learnt it from other people. I feel we need to create a hub of learners where we can meet, share knowledge and collaborate with each other. </p>

  <p><strong>Katja: (<a href="https://twitter.com/kdurrani" title="Follow Katja on Twitter">@kdurrani</a>)</strong>  I have been fascinated by the web since uploading my first html file in 2000 and creating a personal website. I have now been developing for the web professionally for over 5 years. I too keep learning new things all the time and I'm loving it. The only thing is that working and learning from home can become a bit solitary, and for long stretches there is no feedback. So teaming up with others in a similar situation seems a good idea!</p>
